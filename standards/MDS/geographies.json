    "description": "The geography API endpoints are intended to be implemented by regulatory agencies and consumed by mobility providers. Providers query the Policy API to get information about geographical regions for regulatory and other purposes.<br>The Mobility Data Specification (MDS), a project of the Open Mobility Foundation (OMF), is a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) focused on shared mobility services such as dockless scooters, bicycles, mopeds, and carshare, and inspired by projects like GTFS and GBFS."
