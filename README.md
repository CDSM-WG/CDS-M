# CDS-M
City Data Standard for Mobility

The City Data Standard for Mobility (CDS-M) is an initiative to develop a standardised way to communicate data between Transport Operators (TOs) and the Govermental Departments on whose infrastructure they operate.  The purpose of this definiton is to achieve a level of standardisation within the European Union in line with existing EU laws and legistation relating to transportation standards and privacy.

The aim of the CDS-M is to aree on **The Standard** that will be used for the communication, and **The Agreement** for the use of this data, as part of a Business to Government collaboration (B2G).  

## The Standard

The key areas that The Standard will address are: Policy; Planning; Enforcement.

The Standard of the CDS-M will not look to create new standards where existing standards provide relevant and necessary coverage to the objective of the collection and processing of data.

Standards currently identified as being relevant for the purpose of data collection by Cities are as follows:

* [DATEXII](https://datex2.eu/)
* [GBFS](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs)
* [GTFS-Realtime](https://github.com/google/transit/tree/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en)
* [MDS](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification)
* [NeTEx](https://github.com/NeTEx-CEN/NeTEx)
* [SIRI](https://www.siri-cen.eu/)
* [TOMP-API](https://github.com/TOMP-WG/TOMP-API)

## The Agreement

The key areas that The Agreement will address are the process, security and privacy considerations relating to: Collection, Storage, Usage, and Removal of data. 

The need for this Agreement is to ensure that the exchange of B2G data within the EU, gives consideration to the main party involved in this exchange of data, that of the end user.  This is inline with the GDPR Law around the use of an individual’s personal data. 

## Benefits of the CDS-M

The CDS-M provides a common framework of communication to reduce the need for technical development and management overhead of data exchange between TOs and Cities.

Without standardisation, ongoing effort would be required by individual parties to deal with a mixed matrix of different formats and data sets for each TO vs each City’s data requirements on a per city license basis.   This matrix will only amplified as we move across the multiple TOs and Cities at the European level.

The CDS-M also provides greater access to existing data made available for exchange by market parties.  A city can therefore access and invite new modalities into its infrastructure using past data sets from other cities as reference.  TOs can also enter new markets without the need for creating additional data exchange formats.

The use Case templates ensure that all aspects of relating to the exchange of data is clearly defined and legally sound within the context of the European Union.
