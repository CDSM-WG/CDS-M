    "description": "Like vehicle-status, but with one adjustment: the vehicle_id doesn't rotate (causing GDPR issues). <br>The General Bikeshare Feed Specification, known as GBFS, is the open data standard for shared mobility. GBFS makes real-time data feeds in a uniform format publicly available online, with an emphasis on findability. GBFS is intended to make information publicly available online; therefore information that is personally identifiable is not currently and will not become part of the core specification.",
