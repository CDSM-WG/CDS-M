    "description": "The Policy API endpoints are intended to be implemented by regulatory agencies and consumed by mobility providers. Providers query the Policy API to get information about local rules that may affect the operation of their mobility service or which may be used to determine compliance.<br>The Mobility Data Specification (MDS), a project of the Open Mobility Foundation (OMF), is a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) focused on shared mobility services such as dockless scooters, bicycles, mopeds, and carshare, and inspired by projects like GTFS and GBFS."
