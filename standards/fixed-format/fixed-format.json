    "description": "<b>A separated values (CSV) file</b> is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format. A CSV file typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line will have the same number of fields.<br><b>GeoJSON</b> is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on the JSON format.<br><b>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</b> is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values). It is a common data format with diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers.<br><b>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</b> is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable"
