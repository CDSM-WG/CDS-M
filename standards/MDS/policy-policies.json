Providers query the Policy API to get information about local rules that may affect the operation of their mobility service or which may be used to determine compliance.<br>The Mobility Data Specification (MDS), a project of the Open Mobility Foundation (OMF), is a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) focused on shared mobility services such as dockless scooters, bicycles, mopeds, and carshare, and inspired by projects like GTFS and GBFS.",
